# js-code-challenges

Code challenges in javascript.

Created to record my activities practicing solving code challenges using effective problem solving techniques.

The code in this repository is not to be evaluated as the best code for the problem - instead the code is an honest result of my attempts to solve a problem, and not consider the most elegant or shortest-line-count solution(s).

## Goals

- Whiteboard a possible solution to the code challenge.
- Generate a module file to contain the developed solution and export at least one function.
- Create unit tests in a separate file that can test the module file.
- Unit tests must pass.

An additional README file could be created for challenges but don't count on it.
